Data acquisition scripts for MatLab 2015b 32bit using data acquisition toolbox 3.8

-------------------
> These scripts were written for the acquisition of:
>- EMG signal (or various other signals)
>- Pupil size and position (with a Basler cam)
>- Heart rate (using a PulseOxi meter from Starr)
>- Ultra-sound 250kHz (using the ultraMic 250)

> All scripts make use off specific hardware and are designed to function in the [InVivoTools-Toolbox] by A. Heimel.
> These scripts are part of a master thesis and there will be no update nor improving of functionality outside InVivotools.
